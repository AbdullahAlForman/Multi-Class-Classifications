# Multi-Class Classification Project  

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** implementing a multi-class classification model, designed to tackle complex predictive problems involving multiple output categories. The notebook demonstrates data preparation, model training, and evaluation with detailed explanations and reusable code.

## **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- **Model Implementation**: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms for multi-class classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for detailed performance analysis.
- **Visualization**: Provides insightful graphs and plots to interpret model performance and predictions.

## **Requirements**
The project uses Python and requires the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (if applicable)

Install dependencies via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-class-classification.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Multi-class_Classification.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to understand and execute the multi-class classification workflow.
